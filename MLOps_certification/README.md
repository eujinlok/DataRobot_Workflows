## Overview
Using this repository to experiment the MLOPs process and creating the solution for certification

```

This is just a copy of the 2 main templates from the original 'custom-model-templates' from DataRobot. 

```

```
This is where all the magic happens. This folder also contains the final submissions for the MLOps certification process. There's a seperate readme file that will detail the process in more detail
