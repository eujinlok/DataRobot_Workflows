# MLOps sanbox 

## Overview 
This project folder contains all the files and artifacts used during the process of experimenting with MLOps in all shape and form. This folder was also used to create the final submission for the MLOps certification 

For more details of the certification process go through, check out the notebooks: 

```
Build_Custom_Model.ipynb
```
This is the start of the process. The notebook details the process of getting the data, munging it and then building a model to be uploaded to MLOps as a custom model. This is the first step essentially

```
Accuracy_Tracking_Update_Model.ipynb
```
The crux of MLOps is contained in this notebook. This notebook details the submission of the test data and the actuals to MLOps. 

It demonstrates the data drift on 3 perspectives - feature, prediction and accuracy, and rebuilds a new model to be uploaded again to MLOps to update the degraded model.

# NOTE:
The final submission to the MLOps repo in DataRobot, can be found on the 'cfds-custom_inference_models' repo
